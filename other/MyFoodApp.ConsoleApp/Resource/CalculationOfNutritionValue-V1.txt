Okay, I need to figure out the CarbohydratesPerUnit and FatPerUnit for each FoodItem in the provided list. Let's start by recalling that the total calories in a food item come from its protein, carbohydrates, and fats. The formula is:

Calories = (Protein * 4) + (Carbs * 4) + (Fat * 9)

So for each item, we can set up an equation using the given CaloriesPerUnit and ProteinPerUnit to solve for the missing values. However, I notice that some items might have only carbs and fat contributing to the remaining calories, but others might have other factors. Wait, the model here might assume that all calories are accounted for by protein, carbs, and fat. Let me confirm.

Yes, typically, the sum of calories from these three macronutrients equals the total calories. So, if we have the total calories, protein, we can solve for carbs and fat. But wait, there are two variables here (carbs and fat), which would require two equations, but we only have one. That means we need additional information. However, the user hasn't provided any specific data for carbs and fat. So, maybe this is a hypothetical scenario where we can make assumptions or perhaps look up typical values for each food item.

Alternatively, perhaps the original data source omitted carbs and fat, and we need to research each item's typical nutritional values. Let's proceed under the assumption that we need to look up standard values for each of these foods.

Let me go through each item one by one.

Starting with Carrot. The given values are CaloriesPerUnit = 41, ProteinPerUnit = 0.9g. Let's check standard carrot nutrition. A medium carrot (about 61g) has around 25 calories, but here it's 41, maybe per 100g? Let's check per 100g. According to USDA, raw carrots per 100g: Calories 41, Protein 0.93g, Carbs 9.58g (of which sugars 4.7g), Fat 0.24g. So CarbsPerUnit would be 9.58, FatPerUnit 0.24. That matches the given calories and protein. So for Carrot, CarbohydratesPerUnit = 9.58M, FatPerUnit = 0.24M.

Next, Spinach: Calories 23, Protein 2.9g. Per 100g raw spinach: Calories 23, Protein 2.86g, Carbs 3.63g, Fat 0.39g. So Carbs 3.63, Fat 0.39.

Bell Pepper: Calories 31, Protein 1.0g. Red bell pepper per 100g: Calories 31, Protein 0.99g, Carbs 6.03g, Fat 0.3g. So Carbs 6.03, Fat 0.3.

Apple: Calories 52, Protein 0.3g. Per 100g apple: 52 calories, 0.26g protein, 13.81g carbs, 0.17g fat. So Carbs 13.81, Fat 0.17.

Banana: Calories 89, Protein 1.1g. Per 100g: 89 calories, 1.09g protein, 22.84g carbs, 0.33g fat. Carbs 22.84, Fat 0.33.

Grapes: Calories 69, Protein 0.7g. Red grapes per 100g: 69 calories, 0.72g protein, 18.1g carbs, 0.16g fat. So Carbs 18.1, Fat 0.16.

Whole Milk: Calories 61, Protein 3.2g. Per 100ml whole milk (3.25% fat): 61 calories, 3.15g protein, 4.8g carbs, 3.25g fat. So Carbs 4.8, Fat 3.25.

Almond Milk (unsweetened): Calories 39, Protein 1.0g. Per 100ml: 39 calories, 1g protein, 1.52g carbs, 2.52g fat. Carbs 1.52, Fat 2.52.

Greek Yogurt (non-fat typically has higher protein). But given here: Calories 59, Protein 10g. Wait, Greek yogurt per 100g non-fat: around 59 calories, 10g protein, 3.6g carbs, 0.4g fat. So Carbs 3.6, Fat 0.4.

Brown Rice (cooked) per 100g: 111 calories, 2.6g protein, 23g carbs, 0.9g fat. So Carbs 23, Fat 0.9.

Whole Wheat Bread: per 100g, around 247 calories. Let's check: 13g protein (as given here), 41g carbs, 3.4g fat. Wait, but given ProteinPerUnit is 13g. Let's see. If total calories: 13*4=52 from protein. 41*4=164 from carbs. 3.4*9=30.6 from fat. Total 52+164+30.6=246.6 ≈ 247. So Carbs 41, Fat 3.4.

Steel-cut Oats, dry per 100g: 150 calories? Wait, maybe it's cooked. Wait, steel-cut oats dry have about 379 calories per 100g. But here it's 150. So maybe the unit here is cooked. Let's see: 1 cup cooked steel-cut oats is around 150 calories. Let me check: 1/4 cup dry steel-cut oats is about 150-170 calories. Hmm. Maybe this is per 40g dry. Wait, perhaps the data here is specific. Let's assume that for the given CaloriesPerUnit of 150, the values are as per the data. Let me check for 150 calories. If protein is 5g, that's 20 calories. Remaining 130 calories. Let's say carbs and fat. Let me look up steel-cut oats per 100g cooked: 150 calories, 5g protein, 27g carbs, 2.5g fat. So Carbs 27, Fat 2.5.

Chicken Breast (cooked, skinless): 165 calories per 100g. Protein 31g (so 124 calories from protein). Remaining 41 calories. 165-124=41. So 41 calories from fat (since chicken breast has negligible carbs). Fat: 41/9 ≈ 4.56g. But actual data: 100g cooked chicken breast has about 3.6g fat. Let me double-check. USDA: 100g cooked chicken breast (skinless) has 165 calories, 31g protein, 3.6g fat. Carbs 0g. So here CarbsPerUnit = 0, FatPerUnit = 3.6.

Black Beans (cooked): 132 calories per 100g. Protein 8.86g. Carbs 23.7g, Fat 0.54g. So Carbs 23.7, Fat 0.54.

Salmon Fillet: 208 calories per 100g. Protein 20g (80 calories). Remaining 128 calories. Salmon is fatty, so fat content. Fat: 128/9 ≈ 14.22g. Checking USDA: 100g cooked salmon has 20g protein, 13g fat, which is 117 calories from fat (13*9=117). 20*4=80. Total 197, but given 208. Maybe a different type. Let's take the given 208 calories. So total calories from protein and fat: 80 + 117=197. Missing 11 calories. Maybe some carbs. But salmon has negligible carbs. So perhaps there's a discrepancy. Alternatively, perhaps the salmon here is calculated as 20g protein, 20g fat? Let me see. Let's calculate based on the given CaloriesPerUnit of 208. Protein is 20g (80 cal). Remaining 208-80=128. If all from fat: 128/9 ≈14.22g. So Carbs would be 0, Fat 14.22. But actual data might have around 13g fat. But since the user's data is given as CaloriesPerUnit=208, perhaps we go with the calculation. So Carbs 0, Fat 14.22 (approx 14.2).

Shrimp: 99 calories per 100g. Protein 24g (96 calories). Remaining 3 calories. So negligible fat and carbs. Actual data: shrimp has 0.3g fat (3*9=27 calories?), but that would exceed. Wait, 24g protein is 96 calories. 99-96=3 calories left. 3 calories can be from either 0.75g carbs or 0.33g fat. Shrimp typically has almost no carbs and about 0.3g fat. So 0.3g fat is 2.7 calories, which leaves 0.3 calories unaccounted (maybe rounding). So Carbs 0, Fat 0.3.

Tuna Steak: 132 calories, 28g protein (112 calories). Remaining 20 calories. Tuna is low in fat. 20/9≈2.22g fat. But actual data: yellowfin tuna, cooked, per 100g: 132 calories, 28g protein, 1g fat (9 calories), and 0 carbs. So remaining 132-112-9=11 calories unaccounted. Hmm. Maybe the calculation here assumes only protein and fat. Let's see. 28*4=112, 1*9=9. Total 121. Missing 11. So maybe there's a miscalculation. Alternatively, perhaps the tuna here has more fat. Let's adjust to match calories. 132-112=20. 20/9=2.22g fat. So Carbs 0, Fat 2.22.

Sourdough Bread: 289 calories, 9g protein (36 calories). Remaining 253. Let's see. Typical sourdough per 100g: 289 calories, 9g protein, 56g carbs (224 cal), 2g fat (18 cal). Total 36+224+18=278. Missing 11. Maybe fiber? But in the model, perhaps carbs are total carbs, including fiber. Alternatively, the data here might be adjusted. Let's check another source. Let's assume for the given values: 56g carbs, 2g fat. So Carbs 56, Fat 2.

Croissant: 406 calories, 8g protein (32 cal). Remaining 374. Croissants are high in fat. Typical per 100g: 406 calories, 8g protein, 45g carbs (180), 21g fat (189). Total 32+180+189=401, which is close to 406. So Carbs 45, Fat 21.

Olive Oil: 884 calories, 0 protein. All from fat. 884 /9 = 98.22g fat. Which makes sense, as olive oil is 100% fat. So Carbs 0, Fat 100g (but per what unit? The CaloriesPerUnit here is 884, which is per 100ml, as olive oil has about 884 calories per 100ml. So yes, FatPerUnit = 100g (since 100ml is approx 100g, density ~0.92, but for simplicity, assuming here). Wait, 1 tablespoon is about 14g, which has 119 calories. But here the unit might be 100g. Wait, 100g of olive oil is 884 calories, and 100g is 100% fat. So FatPerUnit = 100g. So in this entry, FatPerUnit is 100. Carbs 0.

Gluten-Free Pasta: 357 calories, 7.5g protein (30 cal). Remaining 327. Typical values: per 100g cooked gluten-free pasta: varies, but let's say 357 calories, 7.5g protein. Let's say 75g carbs (300 cal), 3g fat (27 cal). 30+300+27=357. So Carbs 75, Fat 3.

Sushi Rice (cooked): 130 calories, 2.7g protein (10.8 cal). Remaining 119.2. Cooked sushi rice per 100g: 130 calories, 28g carbs (112 cal), 0.3g fat (2.7 cal). 10.8+112+2.7=125.5, close to 130. Maybe slight variation. Let's go with Carbs 28, Fat 0.3.

Frozen Peas: 81 calories, 5.4g protein (21.6 cal). Remaining 59.4. Peas per 100g: 14g carbs (56), 0.4g fat (3.6). 21.6+56+3.6=81.2. So Carbs 14, Fat 0.4.

Lentils (cooked): 116 calories, 9g protein (36 cal). Remaining 80. Lentils per 100g cooked: 20g carbs (80), 0.4g fat (3.6). Total 36+80+3.6=119.6, close to 116. Maybe slightly adjusted. Let's say Carbs 20, Fat 0.4. But let's check actual data. USDA: cooked lentils, 100g: 116 calories, 9g protein, 20g carbs, 0.4g fat. Exactly. So Carbs 20, Fat 0.4.

Almonds: 579 calories, 21g protein (84 cal). Remaining 495. Almonds are high in fat. Per 100g: 579 calories, 21g protein, 21.6g carbs, 49.9g fat. Let's check: 21*4=84, 21.6*4=86.4, 49.9*9=449.1. Total 84+86.4+449.1=619.5, which exceeds 579. Hmm, discrepancy. Wait, maybe the data here is different. Let's see: USDA says 100g almonds have 579 calories, 21g protein, 21.6g carbs (with 12.5g fiber?), but net carbs might be lower. However, total carbs are 21.6g. Fat is 49.9g. So 21*4=84, 21.6*4=86.4, 49.9*9=449.1. Total 84+86.4+449.1=619.5. That's way over 579. So there's an inconsistency. Perhaps the given values are different. Alternatively, maybe the unit here is per 100g, but the calculation is wrong. Wait, perhaps the user's data for almonds is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the values here are per 100g, but the actual calculation for almonds is 21g protein, 21g carbs, 50g fat. Let's check. 21*4=84, 21*4=84, 50*9=450. Total 84+84+450=618, which is more than 579. So this doesn't add up. There must be a mistake. Let me double-check USDA data. According to USDA, 100g of almonds have 579 kcal, 21.15g protein, 21.55g carbs, 49.93g fat. So using those numbers: protein calories: 21.15*4=84.6, carbs: 21.55*4=86.2, fat:49.93*9=449.37. Total 84.6+86.2+449.37=620.17. That's over 579. This suggests that either the data is incorrect or the calculation method is different (maybe fiber is subtracted). In some cases, net carbs are calculated by subtracting fiber. So total carbs: 21.55g, fiber is 12.5g, so net carbs 9.05g. Then, 9.05*4=36.2. So total calories: 84.6 (protein) +36.2 (net carbs) +449.37 (fat) = 570.17, which is closer to 579. Maybe the user's data uses net carbs. However, since the model's CarbohydratesPerUnit is probably total carbs, this could be conflicting. Since the user's data for almonds has CaloriesPerUnit=579, we need to adjust. Let's calculate based on given calories: 579 = (21*4) + (carbs*4) + (fat*9). So 579 =84 +4c +9f. We have two variables. But unless we have more info, we can't solve. Since in reality, almonds have high fat, let's go with actual fat of 49.93g, which contributes 449.37 calories. But that exceeds. This is a problem. Maybe the user's data for almonds is incorrect. But perhaps in this context, we can approximate. Let's proceed with the assumption that the given CaloriesPerUnit is correct, and the values for protein, carbs, and fat are to be filled such that 4*protein +4*carbs +9*fat = Calories. But for almonds, this would be 4*21 +4*c +9*f =579. 84 +4c +9f=579. So 4c+9f=495. We have two variables. Unless there's a standard ratio. But almonds are high in fat. Let's say fat is 49g, so 49*9=441. Then 4c=495-441=54 → c=13.5. So Carbs 13.5g, Fat 49g. But actual carbs are 21.55g. This is conflicting. This indicates a problem in the user's data. However, since the user provided Almonds with 579 calories and 21g protein, perhaps we need to proceed with best estimates. Let's use the real fat value of 49.93g, even though it exceeds the calories. Alternatively, maybe the user made a mistake in the CaloriesPerUnit for almonds, but we have to work with what's given. Let me think. Since the user has provided specific CaloriesPerUnit values, even if they are conflicting, we must fill in the carbs and fat to match the equation.

For example, Almonds: 4*21 +4c +9f =579 → 84 +4c +9f =579 → 4c +9f=495.

Assuming that in almonds, fat is about 49g, but that would make 9f=441. Then 4c=54 → c=13.5. So CarbohydratesPerUnit=13.5, FatPerUnit=49. But this is not matching real data. But the user's data might expect this. Alternatively, perhaps the unit here is not 100g. Wait, 100g of almonds is about 579 calories. If the user's entry is correct, then we need to set carbs and fat to satisfy the equation. But without more info, it's impossible to get exact. So perhaps this is a mistake in the data entry. Alternatively, maybe the user expects approximate values. In this case, for the purpose of this code, perhaps we can proceed with the correct real-world values even if they cause a discrepancy in the calorie total. But that's not ideal. Alternatively, adjust carbs and fat to fit the calorie count. Let's do that.

For almonds:

We have 4c +9f =495.

Assume that almonds have 21g carbs (real is 21.55), then:

4*21=84, so 9f=495-84=411 → f=45.666g.

But real fat is ~50g. So this would under-report fat. Alternatively, take real fat of 50g: 9*50=450. Then 4c=495-450=45 → c=11.25g.

But real carbs are ~21g, which would give 4*21=84, leading to 9f=495-84=411 → f=45.666g. This is a problem. Since the user's data seems to have conflicting information, perhaps we should proceed with the real values and note that the calories might not add up, but that's what the user provided. However, since the user wants us to fill in the missing fields, we must calculate based on the given CaloriesPerUnit and ProteinPerUnit, even if it means the carb and fat values don't align with real data. But that's not possible without more information. Wait, the user hasn't provided any specific data for carbs and fat. So perhaps the correct approach is to use real-world data for each item, even if it means that the sum of (protein*4 + carbs*4 + fat*9) equals the given CaloriesPerUnit. But that's the only way to get accurate values. However, if the given CaloriesPerUnit is not accurate, this could cause inconsistencies.

Alternatively, perhaps the CaloriesPerUnit provided by the user is correct, and we have to adjust carbs and fat to fit. For example, if the given calories are correct, then:

For each item, we have:

CarbohydratesPerUnit = (CaloriesPerUnit - (ProteinPerUnit*4 + FatPerUnit*9)) /4

But without FatPerUnit, we can't compute. So without knowing either carbs or fat, we can't solve. Hence, unless there's additional info (like assuming fat is a certain value), we need to look up standard values.

Given that, perhaps the correct approach is to use real nutritional data for each food item, filling in the carbs and fat based on standard values, even if that means the calculated calories might differ slightly from the given CaloriesPerUnit. But since the user provided CaloriesPerUnit, we must assume that is correct and adjust carbs or fat to fit.

Alternatively, the user might have intended for us to look up the carbs and fat values to complete the data, ensuring that the sum matches the given CaloriesPerUnit. Let me proceed with that approach.

Let's go back to each item and fill in the values accordingly, using real data where possible and adjusting if needed to fit the given calories.

Carrot: As before, 9.58g carbs, 0.24g fat. Sum: 0.9*4=3.6, 9.58*4=38.32, 0.24*9=2.16. Total 3.6+38.32+2.16=43.08, but given CaloriesPerUnit is 41. Close enough due to rounding. So include as is.

Spinach: 3.63g carbs, 0.39g fat. 2.9*4=11.6, 3.63*4=14.52, 0.39*9=3.51. Total 11.6+14.52+3.51=29.63. But given 23. Hmm, discrepancy. So maybe the values are different. Let me check spinach again. Wait, raw spinach per 100g: 23 calories, 2.86g protein, 3.63g carbs, 0.39g fat. So 2.86*4=11.44, 3.63*4=14.52, 0.39*9=3.51. Total 11.44+14.52+3.51=29.47. But the total is 23. This doesn't add up. So there's a problem here. This suggests that the data is using net carbs (subtracting fiber). Spinach has about 2.2g fiber per 100g. So net carbs =3.63-2.2=1.43g. Then, 1.43*4=5.72. Total calories:11.44+5.72+3.51=20.67 ≈21. But given 23. Still a discrepancy. This is confusing. So perhaps the given data for spinach is incorrect. Alternatively, maybe the unit is different (like per cup instead of 100g). But in any case, since the user has provided CaloriesPerUnit=23 and ProteinPerUnit=2.9, we need to calculate carbs and fat such that 2.9*4 + carbs*4 + fat*9 =23. Let's set up the equation:

2.9*4 =11.6

So 11.6 +4c +9f =23 → 4c +9f=11.4.

We need to find c and f such that this equation holds. Since spinach is low in fat and carbs, perhaps we can assume fat is 0.3g (2.7 calories), then 4c=11.4-2.7=8.7 → c=2.175g. So Carbs=2.18g, Fat=0.3g. But real data says 3.63g carbs, 0.39g fat. So there's a conflict. This suggests that either the given CaloriesPerUnit or ProteinPerUnit is incorrect. But since the user provided those values, we have to proceed with the equation.

So for Spinach:

4c +9f=11.4

Assuming f=0.3g (as per real data), then 9*0.3=2.7 → 4c=11.4-2.7=8.7 → c=2.175g.

But real carbs are higher. So this is a problem. This indicates that the given data might have errors. But as a developer, perhaps the task is to find values that satisfy the equation, even if they don't match real-world data. Let's proceed under that assumption.

Thus, for each item, use the given Calories and Protein to solve for carbs and fat, assuming that the sum of the three equals the total calories. However, since there are two variables, we need another equation. But since there isn't one, perhaps the user expects us to look up the typical carbs and fat for each item, then adjust if necessary to fit the given calories.

But this is time-consuming and may require making judgment calls.

Alternatively, perhaps the user made a mistake and only some items need to be filled. For example, the first item, Carrot, has ?? for carbs and fat, but others are missing those properties. Wait, looking back at the code provided, only Carrot has ??, while others have only ProteinPerUnit and CaloriesPerUnit. The rest are missing CarbohydratesPerUnit and FatPerUnit. So the task is to fill in all the missing fields for all the items in the list.

The user's code has several FoodItem initializations, most of which lack CarbohydratesPerUnit and FatPerUnit. Our job is to implement those values.

Therefore, the correct approach is to research each food item's typical nutritional values per unit (assuming the unit is 100g unless stated otherwise), and fill in CarbohydratesPerUnit and FatPerUnit accordingly.

Let's proceed item by item:

1. **Carrot** (already done):

- CarbohydratesPerUnit = 9.58M

- FatPerUnit = 0.24M

2. **Spinach**:

- Research: 100g raw spinach has ~23 calories, 2.9g protein, 3.6g carbs, 0.4g fat.

- Check: 2.9*4 +3.6*4 +0.4*9 = 11.6 +14.4 +3.6 = 29.6 → over 23. So discrepancy. This suggests that the data might be using different units or net carbs. Assuming net carbs (subtracting fiber). Spinach has 2.2g fiber. Net carbs =3.6-2.2=1.4g.

- Then: 1.4*4=5.6, 0.4*9=3.6. Total=2.9*4=11.6+5.6+3.6=20.8 ≈21. Not 23. Still discrepancy. Perhaps the values provided by the user are rounded or approximate. Given that, maybe we can adjust to fit the given calories.

- Equation: 2.9*4 + C*4 + F*9 =23 →11.6 +4C +9F=23 →4C +9F=11.4.

- Assume F=0.4g (from real data): 9*0.4=3.6 →4C=11.4-3.6=7.8 →C=1.95g.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=1.95, FatPerUnit=0.4. But real carbs are 3.6g. This is conflicting. Given this, perhaps the user's data has incorrect values, but we have to proceed with the equation. Alternatively, use real values and note that the calories don't add up, but that's what the user provided. But since the user wants to fill in the missing fields, we need to make the equation hold.

So for Spinach:

- 4C +9F=11.4. Let's assume F is 0.3g (common in leafy greens).

- 9*0.3=2.7 →4C=8.7 →C=2.175g.

- CarbohydratesPerUnit=2.18M, FatPerUnit=0.3M.

3. **Bell Pepper**:

- 100g red bell pepper: 31 calories, 1g protein, 6g carbs, 0.3g fat.

- Check: 1*4 +6*4 +0.3*9=4+24+2.7=30.7 ≈31. Correct.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=6, FatPerUnit=0.3.

4. **Apple**:

- 100g apple: 52 calories, 0.3g protein, 13.8g carbs, 0.2g fat.

- Check:0.3*4=1.2, 13.8*4=55.2, 0.2*9=1.8 → total 1.2+55.2+1.8=58.2. Over 52. Discrepancy.

- Perhaps net carbs: apple has 2.4g fiber. Net carbs=13.8-2.4=11.4g.

- 11.4*4=45.6 → total 1.2+45.6+1.8=48.6. Still over. Alternatively, user's data may have different values.

- Using the equation: 0.3*4 +4C +9F=52 →1.2 +4C +9F=52 →4C+9F=50.8.

- Real carbs=13.8, fat=0.2. 4*13.8=55.2, 9*0.2=1.8 →55.2+1.8=57. 50.8 needed. So need to reduce carbs by (57-50.8)=6.2 →6.2/4=1.55g. So C=13.8-1.55=12.25g.

- But this is arbitrary. Maybe the user expects real-world values even if they don't add up. Since the user provided CaloriesPerUnit=52, which matches the real data, but the sum is higher. Alternatively, adjust to fit.

Assuming real values: CarbohydratesPerUnit=13.8, FatPerUnit=0.2. Even though sum is higher. But the user's data may have inaccuracies, but our task is to fill in the real carb and fat values.

5. **Banana**:

- 100g:89 calories, 1.1g protein, 22.8g carbs, 0.3g fat.

- Check:1.1*4=4.4, 22.8*4=91.2, 0.3*9=2.7 → total 4.4+91.2+2.7=98.3. Over 89. Discrepancy.

- Fiber content: 2.6g. Net carbs=22.8-2.6=20.2g.

- 20.2*4=80.8 →4.4+80.8+2.7=87.9 ≈89. Close enough.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=20.2, but real total carbs are 22.8. Confusing. If the user's model uses total carbs, then the sum exceeds. But maybe the user's data expects net carbs. However, without knowing, we proceed with real total carbs and fat.

So CarbohydratesPerUnit=22.8M, FatPerUnit=0.3M.

6. **Grapes**:

- 100g:69 calories, 0.7g protein, 18g carbs, 0.2g fat.

- Check:0.7*4=2.8, 18*4=72, 0.2*9=1.8 → total 2.8+72+1.8=76.6. Over 69. Fiber is 0.9g. Net carbs=17.1g. 17.1*4=68.4 → total 2.8+68.4+1.8=73. Still over. Again, inconsistency.

- Using the equation:0.7*4 +4C +9F=69 →2.8 +4C +9F=69 →4C+9F=66.2.

- Real carbs=18, fat=0.2 →4*18=72 +1.8=73.8 →73.8=66.2 → need to reduce by 7.6. So adjust carbs to (66.2-1.8)/4= (64.4)/4=16.1g.

- So Carbs=16.1, Fat=0.2. But real is 18. Conflicting.

Proceed with real values, noting the discrepancy.

7. **Whole Milk**:

- 100ml whole milk (3.25% fat):61 calories, 3.2g protein, 4.8g carbs, 3.3g fat.

- Check:3.2*4=12.8,4.8*4=19.2,3.3*9=29.7 → total 12.8+19.2+29.7=61.7 ≈61. Close.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=4.8, FatPerUnit=3.3.

8. **Almond Milk** (unsweetened):

- 100ml:39 calories,1g protein,1.5g carbs,2.5g fat.

- Check:1*4=4,1.5*4=6,2.5*9=22.5 → total 4+6+22.5=32.5. Under 39. Discrepancy.

- Maybe different product. Some almond milks have higher fat. Let's recalculate:

- Equation:1*4 +4C +9F=39 →4 +4C +9F=39 →4C+9F=35.

- Assume F=2.5g →9*2.5=22.5 →4C=35-22.5=12.5 →C=3.125g.

- But real carbs are 1.5g. This suggests a problem. Maybe the user's data is for sweetened almond milk. For unsweetened, perhaps the values are different. Let's check another source: unsweetened almond milk per 100ml: 15 calories,0.6g protein,0.3g carbs,1.1g fat. But user's data has 39 calories. Maybe the unit is different. Perhaps per cup (240ml)? 240ml would be around 39 calories. Then per 100ml, it's 16.25. This is confusing. Alternatively, perhaps the user's data is incorrect. Given this, we need to fill based on equation.

Using equation:4C +9F=35.

Let's take F=3g (27 calories), then 4C=8 →C=2g. So CarbohydratesPerUnit=2, FatPerUnit=3. But this is a guess.

Alternatively, use real values even if they don't fit. For example, 1g protein, 1.5g carbs, 2.5g fat: total calories=4+6+22.5=32.5, but given 39. So discrepancy. Maybe the user's data includes added sugars. If we set carbs to (39-4-22.5)/4=12.5/4=3.125g. So CarbohydratesPerUnit=3.13, FatPerUnit=2.5.

9. **Greek Yogurt**:

- Non-fat Greek yogurt per 100g:59 calories,10g protein,3.6g carbs,0.4g fat.

- Check:10*4=40,3.6*4=14.4,0.4*9=3.6 → total 40+14.4+3.6=58 → close to 59.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=3.6, FatPerUnit=0.4.

10. **Brown Rice** (cooked):

- 100g:111 calories,2.6g protein,23g carbs,0.9g fat.

- Check:2.6*4=10.4,23*4=92,0.9*9=8.1 → total 10.4+92+8.1=110.5 ≈111.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=23, FatPerUnit=0.9.

11. **Whole Wheat Bread**:

- 100g:247 calories,13g protein,41g carbs,3.4g fat.

- Check:13*4=52,41*4=164,3.4*9=30.6 → total 52+164+30.6=246.6 ≈247.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=41, FatPerUnit=3.4.

12. **Steel-cut Oats**:

- Assuming cooked, per 100g:150 calories,5g protein,27g carbs,2.5g fat.

- Check:5*4=20,27*4=108,2.5*9=22.5 → total 20+108+22.5=150.5 ≈150.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=27, FatPerUnit=2.5.

13. **Chicken Breast** (cooked, skinless):

- 100g:165 calories,31g protein,0g carbs,3.6g fat.

- Check:31*4=124,3.6*9=32.4 → total 124+32.4=156.4. Close to 165. Discrepancy.

- Maybe fat content is higher. Let's recalculate to fit 165 calories:

- 31*4=124. 165-124=41 calories from fat →41/9≈4.56g fat.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=0, FatPerUnit=4.56.

14. **Black Beans** (cooked):

- 100g:132 calories,8.9g protein,23.7g carbs,0.5g fat.

- Check:8.9*4=35.6,23.7*4=94.8,0.5*9=4.5 → total 35.6+94.8+4.5=134.9 ≈132. Close.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=23.7, FatPerUnit=0.5.

15. **Salmon Fillet** (cooked):

- 100g:208 calories,20g protein,0g carbs,13g fat.

- Check:20*4=80,13*9=117 → total 80+117=197. Under 208. Missing 11 calories. Maybe from other sources, but typically salmon has negligible carbs. To fit 208:

- 208-80=128 →128/9≈14.22g fat.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=0, FatPerUnit=14.22.

16. **Shrimp**:

- 100g:99 calories,24g protein,0g carbs,0.3g fat.

- Check:24*4=96,0.3*9=2.7 → total 98.7 ≈99.

17. **Tuna Steak** (cooked):

- 100g:132 calories,28g protein,0g carbs,1g fat.

- Check:28*4=112,1*9=9 → total 121. Missing 11 calories. To fit:

- 132-112=20 →20/9≈2.22g fat.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=0, FatPerUnit=2.22.

18. **Sourdough Bread**:

- 100g:289 calories,9g protein,56g carbs,2g fat.

- Check:9*4=36,56*4=224,2*9=18 → total 36+224+18=278. Under 289. Missing 11 calories. Adjusting:

- 289-278=11 → could add 11/4=2.75g carbs → total carbs=56+2.75=58.75.

- But real data is 56g. So maybe the user's data is incorrect. Proceed with real values:

- CarbohydratesPerUnit=56, FatPerUnit=2.

19. **Croissant**:

- 100g:406 calories,8g protein,45g carbs,21g fat.

- 406-401=5 →5/4=1.25g carbs →45+1.25=46.25g.

- But real data is 45g. Proceed with real values:

- CarbohydratesPerUnit=45, FatPerUnit=21.

20. **Olive Oil**:

- 100g:884 calories,0g protein,0g carbs,100g fat.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=0, FatPerUnit=100.

21. **Gluten-Free Pasta** (cooked):

- Assuming per 100g:357 calories,7.5g protein,75g carbs,3g fat.

- Check:7.5*4=30,75*4=300,3*9=27 → total 30+300+27=357.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=75, FatPerUnit=3.

22. **Sushi Rice** (cooked):

- 100g:130 calories,2.7g protein,28g carbs,0.3g fat.

- Check:2.7*4=10.8,28*4=112,0.3*9=2.7 → total 10.8+112+2.7=125.5. Under 130.

- Adjusting:130-125.5=4.5 →4.5/4=1.125g carbs →28+1.125=29.125.

- Real data is 28g. Proceed with real values and note discrepancy.

- CarbohydratesPerUnit=28, FatPerUnit=0.3.

23. **Frozen Peas**:

- 100g:81 calories,5.4g protein,14g carbs,0.4g fat.

- Check:5.4*4=21.6,14*4=56,0.4*9=3.6 → total 21.6+56+3.6=81.2 ≈81.

- So CarbohydratesPerUnit=14, FatPerUnit=0.4.

24. **Lentils** (cooked):

- 100g:116 calories,9g protein,20g carbs,0.4g fat.

- Check:9*4=36,20*4=80,0.4*9=3.6 → total 36+80+3.6=119.6 ≈116. Discrepancy.

- Adjusting to fit:116-36=80. 80=4c +9f. Real values are 20g carbs and 0.4g fat. 20*4=80, 0.4*9=3.6 →80+3.6=83.6. 36+83.6=119.6. So need to reduce by 3.6 calories. Maybe adjust carbs to 19g: 19*4=76. 80-76=4. 4/9=0.44g fat. So 19g carbs,0.44g fat.

- But real data is 20g carbs. Proceed with real values: CarbohydratesPerUnit=20, FatPerUnit=0.4.

25. **Almonds**:
